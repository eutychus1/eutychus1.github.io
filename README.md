- 🎯 **Hobbies**: A fun insight into my interests like skating, swimming, and DJing  
- 💬 **Languages**: Both spoken and programming languages I’m learning or fluent in  
- 🧠 **Code Samples**: Visual examples of the programming languages I’m using in data analysis and software development  
- 📍 **Contact**: Email, phone number, and location (Nairobi, Kenya — aka "my happy place")
